Detailed Analysis: i }

 

1. Value Added Tax

a) Issues:

Whether company had complied with VAT regulations for filing.
Whether the VAT returns were accurate and appropriately been filed. i
Any possible penalties and assessments identified

Findings

 

Al VAT returns had been filed within due dates as per section 31A of the VAT
Act, that is within 15 days of the following month. |

The company deals in taxable sales only and standard rated to be specific in
line with section 18 of the VAT Act.

We found a number of invoices that had not been declared. These mainly were
parking Invoices of Medical Access and some invoices of Watoto Child care
Ministries. (Find details in attached findings for VAT).

There were also numerical variances between actual !rent invoice amounts on
some invoices of Watoto Child care Ministries and what was declared in the
returns (details in findings VAT section).

We have identified VAT being claimed on food supplies by Baguma restaurant
and Diners’ Choice restaurant. This qualifies to be entertainment expenditure
on which input tax credit would be disallowed. However, basing on the manner
this is managed, we have dropped the matter and allowed claim of the input
tax based on section 28(5) (b) (ii).

There was use of wrong tin for Baguma Restaurant while claiming input VAT in
several months, which could lead to rejection of input'tax credit.

Some input tax credit was claimed on improper tax invoices, as was the case
with Uganda Baati in April 2017, UAP Insurance in June 2017 as well as Winx
Design in March 2017. This contravenes section 29 and as such credit will not be
allowed as per section 28 of the VAT Act.

Some invoices could not be traced, such as Proman Consult in October 2017,
Ernst & Young in June 2016 as other as per details for hit "3

Numerical errors in input tax credit claimed, as was the case with ect
Advocates in September 2017. ‘4H
Some input tax was not claimed on Tax Invoices identified Card System Holding
and Fair Price in October and' December 2016. ' i

We found a variance between the total parking fees declared for the year. 2016
with returns showing 84,960,574 whereas daily parking details amounted to
78,664,407 leaving a variance of 6,296,161. i

The company by end of December 2019 had an offset of Shs. 377,891,511 ‘in
contravention of section 42(3) of the VAT Act. :

Implications i} ' ; { i

|
Failure to have proper Tax’ Invoices will lead to rejection of input: tax credit
hence more tax payable. 1

Numerical errors also|lead to loss of VAT by claiming léss than has been Paid on
the invoice. It will also lead to penalties in cases where more is claimed.

Failure to declare proper output VAT leads to interest ‘as per section 65A of the
VAT Act as less is declared and balance due attracts interest. This might also
be treated as misleading information which calls for penal tax as per section 50
of the Tax Procedures Code Act. I
Failure to apply for refund is an indication on non-compliance and will lead to
additional assessments.

Management Responses

Returns will always be reviewed before filing
Company to consider applying for refund of excess VAT:
All Tax invoices will be kept in both hard and soft copies

Recommendations i it

Always review invoice figures so as to claim and disclose correct amounts

All invoices for both input and output should be kept safely at all times to
avoid penal tax for failure to maintain Proper recordsias per section 49 of the
TPCA, 2014. Res he hy Ai
Claim input tax credit in the period in which it relates, rather than discldsure
in following periods. i 7 :

2. Income Tax

a) Issues |

Whether provisional Tax Returns have been filed and in time i
Whether all expenses claimed are actually allowable under the Act
Whether all penalties relating to late filing have been paid, if any
Whether all incomes have been disclosed in income tax returns i
Whether there are any other further compliance issues to be considered

b) Findings at oe

- The company got registered and filed its first Income Tax Return for the year
ended 31% December, 1939 !

The company’s accounting date is 31* December as per section 39 of the

Income Tax Act as amended {

All income tax returns for the period under review have been filed in, time.

However, there are assessments identified for the years 2010, 2011 and 2013

although there was no tax to pay. { f

- The Return for 2018 had penalties of 2,397, 897 which had not been added
back as per section 22(2) (h)..We have added i these back in revised
computation. Ht

- Travelling expenses appeared to have been’ grossly misstated due to the fact
that the transport forms part of salaries and as such should have been declared
under salaries and wages, lest this variance can be a trigger for audit. |

- We found variances between salaries declared in PAYE returns. and income tax
returns. We have included these in revised income tax computations as
attached. \\ i “lt

- We found repairs of machinery expenses and yet company has no such ‘asséts
showing in the fixed assets. They have been added back as attached. raed

- We identified clearing expenses of 75 million and yet no imports appear 'in the
returns. We have as such disallowed the same in attached revised computation.

Findings |
We found out that the company has been charged WHT on rental income by
Watoto Child Care Ministries Limited

Further, we noted that the company makes payments ‘for Professional feés,
audit fees, and consultancy fees which qualify as WHT items but. no Single
deduction has been made in contravention of section 118 of the Income Tax
Act. These we found that they are local payments. j

; i
We have recomputed the WHT due and found principal. tax Payable of :Shs.
30,840,484.

In getting above figure, we have also charged WHT).on fees Paid on shared |
costs, on which tax was to be withheld since they are/all Professional fees,

We also computed interest of 5,771,528. However, due to Capping rules as per
section 136 (7) and! (8), total interest will be 5,771,528. Please :find attached

d) Management responses

   

PAYE had only been charged on basic pay from January| 2016 to April 2017
instead of being charged on gross pay including transport allowances, This
leaves a principal tax under declaration of 17,101,203)in 2016 and 8,156,706.in
2017. From May 2017 to December 2018, the variance as immaterial

   

No vehicle benefits were indentified

The comparison of salaries’ as per payroll and, PAYE returns led to an ‘under i
declaration of 58,201,500 in:2016 and 28,769,000 in 2017 and 1,265,835 in 2018
and 1,070,000 in 2019

We have considered salaries dectared and transport. in IT return and added
them together as compared to total ‘payroll and identified overstated
differences of 31,316,817, 54,728,036 and 55,308,202: for 2016, 2017 and 2018
respectively. These have been added back in income tax computation, jas

There are commissions given and overtime Payments which are declared ‘in

There are no gratuity payments identified

Staff meals are collectively provided to all staff regardless of their positior :
is supplied by Baguma restaurant and Diners’ choice restaurant. This is
with section 19 (2) (e) and therefore no tax exposure. i ;

Findings |
We found out that the company has been charged WHT on rental income by
Watoto Child Care Ministries Limited

Further, we noted that the company makes payments ‘for Professional feés,
audit fees, and consultancy fees which qualify as WHT items but. no Single
deduction has been made in contravention of section 118 of the Income Tax
Act. These we found that they are local payments. j

; i
We have recomputed the WHT due and found principal. tax Payable of :Shs.
30,840,484.

In getting above figure, we have also charged WHT).on fees Paid on shared |
costs, on which tax was to be withheld since they are/all Professional fees,

We also computed interest of 5,771,528. However, due to Capping rules as per
section 136 (7) and! (8), total interest will be 5,771,528. Please :find attached
workings.

Total WHT payable including interest is Shs. 11,543,056; |

We have considered salaries dectared and transport. in IT return and added
them together as compared to total ‘payroll and identified overstated
